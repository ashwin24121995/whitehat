## Root Cause Analysis

All three critical issues stem from the **same root cause**: Match-related page components are not implemented in the application routing system.

**Technical Analysis:**
- Routes are defined in the navigation/routing configuration
- Links generate correct URLs with match IDs
- Backend API provides match data successfully
- **Missing:** Frontend page components for these routes
- **Result:** React Router shows 404 page for unimplemented routes

**Files That Need to Be Created:**
1. `client/src/pages/CreateTeam.tsx` - Team creation interface
2. `client/src/pages/MatchDetail.tsx` - Match scorecard and details page
3. Route definitions in `client/src/App.tsx` for these pages

---

## Priority Fix Plan

### Phase 1: Create Match Detail Page (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Estimated Effort:** 4-6 hours  
**Impact:** Unblocks viewing live and completed match details

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Create `client/src/pages/MatchDetail.tsx` component
2. Add route in `App.tsx`: `/matches/:matchId`
3. Fetch match data from Cricket API using match ID
4. Display full scorecard with:
   - Team scores and overs
   - Player-by-player performance
   - Match information (venue, date, format)
   - Live commentary (if match is live)
5. Add navigation back to matches list
6. Test with both live and completed matches

**Required API Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/matches/:matchId` - Match details
- `GET /api/matches/:matchId/scorecard` - Full scorecard
- `GET /api/matches/:matchId/commentary` - Live commentary (optional)

---

### Phase 2: Create Team Creation Page (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Estimated Effort:** 8-12 hours  
**Impact:** Unblocks core fantasy cricket functionality

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Create `client/src/pages/CreateTeam.tsx` component
2. Add route in `App.tsx`: `/create-team/:matchId`
3. Implement team builder interface with:
   - Player selection grid (grouped by role)
   - Team composition rules validation (1-4 WK, 3-6 BAT, 1-4 AR, 3-6 BOWL)
   - Credit/budget system (if applicable)
   - Captain & Vice-Captain selection (2x and 1.5x points)
   - Real-time team preview
4. Fetch player data from Cricket API
5. Save team to database via tRPC mutation
6. Redirect to dashboard or match page after team creation
7. Add team edit functionality (before match starts)

**Required API Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/matches/:matchId/players` - Available players for match
- `POST /api/teams` - Save created team
- `PUT /api/teams/:teamId` - Update team (before deadline)

**Required tRPC Procedures:**
- `team.create` - Create new fantasy team
- `team.update` - Update existing team
- `team.getByMatch` - Get user's team for a match

---

### Phase 3: Fix API Authentication (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Estimated Effort:** 2-4 hours  
**Impact:** Ensures reliable real-time data updates

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Review API authentication configuration
2. Check JWT token generation and validation
3. Verify CORS settings for production domain
4. Add proper error handling for 401 responses
5. Implement token refresh mechanism if needed
6. Test API calls in production environment

---

### Phase 4: Dashboard Testing (DEFERRED)
**Status:** Not tested yet (requires authentication)  
**Reason:** Need valid user credentials to test dashboard functionality

**To Be Tested:**
- Dashboard page access
- User profile
- My Teams section
- Leaderboard
- Points tracking
- Match history

## Conclusion

The WHITEHAT Fantasy Cricket website has a solid foundation with well-designed public pages, but **critical core functionality is missing**. The three 404 errors prevent users from:
1. Creating fantasy teams (primary user action)
2. Viewing match details and scorecards (essential information)
3. Analyzing past performance (learning and improvement)

**These issues must be fixed before the platform can be considered functional for users.** The good news is that the root cause is clear (missing page implementations) and the fix is straightforward (create the missing components).

**Estimated Total Fix Time:** 14-22 hours of development work

**Priority Order:**
1. Match Detail Page (4-6 hours) - Quick win, unblocks information access
2. Create Team Page (8-12 hours) - Core functionality
3. API Authentication (2-4 hours) - Stability improvement

Once these issues are resolved, the platform will be fully functional and ready for user testing.

**Next Steps:** Proceed with Phase 1 (Match Detail Page) implementation
